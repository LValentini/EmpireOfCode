#Rotate List

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. Try solving this without creating a copy of the list.

###Input: Two arguments. List of elements and positive integer

###Output: Converter list of elements

###Example:
```javascript
rotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) === [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]
rotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3) === [4, 5, 6,
```
